; Postfix algorithm:
; While there are input tokens left
;  	Read the next token from input.
;	If the token is a value
;		Push it onto the stack.
;	Otherwise, the token is an operator (operator here includes both operators and functions).
;		It is known a priori that the operator takes n arguments.
;		If there are fewer than n values on the stack
;			(Error) The user has not input sufficient values in the expression.
;		Else, Pop the top n values from the stack.
;		Evaluate the operator, with the values as arguments.
;		Push the returned results, if any, back onto the stack.
; If there is only one value in the stack
;	That value is the result of the calculation.
; Otherwise, there are more values in the stack
; 	(Error) The user input has too many values.
