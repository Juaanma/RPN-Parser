# RPN Parser
This is a **reverse Polish notation parser** written in *NASM (32 bits)*. 
The user should enter a valid expression to be evaluated. For example: *'3 5 + 2 *'*, which is the same as doing (3 + 5) * 2 in infix notation, and evaluates to 16. 

As for now, this program doesn't support negative numbers, because it was not the scope of this project to struggle with reading negative operators and taking care of signed operations.

To compile, all you have to do is run *'./compile.bash'*.
