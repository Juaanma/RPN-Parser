# RPN-Parser
This is a reverse Polish notation parser written in NASM (32 bits). The user should enter a valid expression to be evaluated. For example: '3 5 + 2 *'. As for now, this program doesn't support negative numbers, because it was not the scope of the project to implement the difficulties of reading negative operators and taking care of signed operations.
